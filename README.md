# TinyApp Project

>TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

This app was refactored to be more in line as a **single page application (SPA)** the new url and login pages are not neccessary for my app. SPA are better for user experience and design, they reduce clicks and reduce rendering and they present a better architecture of the site. A stretch goal is to complete this proccess.
